# Raspberry Pi Flask Server Projects

While I was at working at Code Ninjas, I developed a Raspberry Pi Python Flask Server curriculum targeted at Middle-High Schoolers.

Code Ninjas is a place I used to work at, it's a educational establishment that aims to teach children programming.

There are three projects that I designed for the camp:

1. Basic HTML Hosting "./Serve HTML"
2. Timer Application "./Timer App"
3. Chat Messaging "./Message Board"

The projects aren't that pretty from a visual standpoint because it's not the focus of the camp.

## Run These Projects

1. Have Python 3.6.x
2. Have Flask installed
3. Navigate to the project directories (`"./Serve HTML"` | `"./Timer App"` | `"./Message Board"`)
4. Run `python ./index.py`
5. In your browser, either visit your machine's IP at port 5000 or visit `localhost:5000`
6. If you want to visit the webapps on other machines on the same network, enable port forwarding.

## Comments
I should've implemented websockets for instantaneous updates between clients. Instead, I just used polling as a way to grab updates.
